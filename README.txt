Prediction Using Unsupervised Machine Learning
By: Prakriti Arora

OBJECTIVE: predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.

From the given student dataset, predict the score if the student studies for 9.25 hrs/day.

ALGORITHM USED - Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. 

Workflow behind Implemention of Linear Regression Algorithm:

1. Import, readand understand the data. 

2. Visualize the data.

3. Train the model. Fit the data into the Linear Regression Model.

4. Test data and modify if required.
